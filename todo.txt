Things to do
============

Also look at http://t-lo.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29079-ahkera for open issues.

General
-------
* Admin view for pipes, messages
* Message routing - router.py? See feeds / POST below
* Message lifecycle (what if e.g. a message is duplicated
  due to multiple receivers? References, and the like...)
* have POST handlers reply with a 201 created instead
   of just calling th GET() handler of the resource created
   (base.py and handler classes)
* check / handle content type in requests
    - message binary content
    - restms+xml content (already handled)
   (base.py and handler classes)
* set / handle content type in responses
    - restms+xml content (already provided)
    - provide JSON output
* conditional requests (depending on header field values)
* clean up models/ sub directory namespace mess (see feed/main.py, line 21)
* get rid off the need for slice base urls in templates
* Asynclets
* Apache httpd mod_python integration
* WSGI integration (Brad?)
* Database-less backend (chaching, python serialization, ???)

processor
---------
- major refacturing
- process JSON content (extend processor.py)
- process multiple RestMS tokens in one request

Pipes
-----
* GET, POST
* new pipe type "push" or "dialback" for having the pipe 
  proacively posting its messages

Messages
--------
* everything, including payload storage concept
* opaque non-enveloped "binary" message content
* CouchDB backend for faster store/retrieve (?)

Feeds
-----
* POST
    - content type evaluation
    - message parsing
    - header object creation
    - content staging

Joins
-----
* headers

Domain
------
* everything
* check for pre-existing FEED on POST...
