Ahkera coding rules and style guide
-----------------------------------

Be sensible. Keep your code lean and readable, just as the RestMS protocol. 
Have a method do one thing, and one thing only. Have a class represent one
thing, and one thing only. Beware of toolbox classes and the like.

File encoding
-------------
All python and resource files are encoded in utf-8.

Line breaks
-----------
Line breaks are <cr> only. No <lf>. Don't even think about <cr><lf>.
(this is: Unix style, not windows style.)

Indentation
-----------
Indentation is crucial in python code as it is part of the python syntax.
Tabs are 4 characters, so indentations are 4 characters. "Tabs", in fact,
are spaces.

Line length and method length
------------------------------
Lines have 80 characters maximum. Methods are 25 lines maximum. If your
code needs more, please refactor. These are somewhat soft rules - 
there might be exceptions. Be prepared to justify your violations, though, 
as you will be intensely challenged for every single one. While being 
waterboarded.
